1:

I started a feminist hackerspace, and I want to tell you about why, and what we're doing, and how you can do it too. 

This talk is titled Divide and Conquer because it's a joke about the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide and conquer algorithm. I want this to be accessible to people with varying backgrounds, so I wanted to explain.

2:
(making things is important)
Why did I start MergeSort? Because making things is important to me. 


3:
 (community is important)
Making things in a community that welcomes me is important to me, because I can learn and do more with help from others.


4:
(safe spaces are important)
So, why did I start MergeSort? I live in New York City. There are options.

I have a lot of respect for the people at Resistor, and Hack Manhattan, and Staten Island Makerspace, and all the other places you can go if you live in New York and want to make something. I don't mean to imply that those are not good places, or not safe spaces. I just wanted something different. I wanted to be somewhere where being a safe space was the top priority. Hackerspaces and makerspaces often have the top priority of being a place for all to make, emphasis on "make". I wanted a place for all to make, emphasis on the parts of "all" that might feel excluded by traditional spaces.

5:
( why not?)

I didn't see anyone else doing exactly what I wanted to do, so when I moved here, I figured there was no reason I couldn't do it myself.

6:
(what does it mean to be feminist?)

Feminism means a lot of things to different people. To me, intersectional feminism is about being accepted for who you are, in all the intersections of possibly marginalized identities you inhabit. 

At MergeSort, we aim to be an inclusive space for people marginalized along axes of gender oppression especially. To this end, we've instituted a membership policy - those who identify as female or as nonbinary are welcome in our space by default, while others must present a compelling reason to join us. This isn't the only way to run a feminist space, and we don't mean to say that men can't be feminists - just that the safety of our members is more important to us than the comfort of the dominant group.

(history: mine. squidwrench, DU, Meetup)
I wanted to talk a little about how I got here. 
I grew up in upstate New York, and attended the hackerspace Squidwrench when I was in college at SUNY New Paltz. 
When I was in college, probably sometime in 2013, I read an article online about Double Union, a feminist hackerspace in San Francisco, and was hugely impressed by them. I realized that, while Poughkeepsie is my home, the Hudson Valley doesn't have the critical mass yet to support multiple hackerspaces. I had friends at Squidwrench anyway, so I left the thought for another day. 

That day came in 2015, when after graduating college, I moved to New York and began working as a software engineer at Meetup.

8: 
(history: MS. twitter, beerops, may, june) 

A couple months after I moved to New York, I was itching to make things with people again. I sent out a call on Twitter for people to help me start a space - I knew I didn't have the resources or skillset to do it alone. 
I also didn't have a ton of Twitter followers, but I'd met Katherine, known on Twitter as @beerops, at a conference I attended while in school. She's currently a devops engineer at Etsy. She responded to my tweet, and after we met to plan in May, we hosted our first Meetup in late June at Etsy Labs.

(grace hopper design pattern)

There's a set of design patterns for hackerspaces, presented five or ten years ago from a prominent hacking conference in Germany. The Grace Hopper pattern comes from a quote from Grace Hopper: It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. There's no reason to wait for everything to be perfect. We started meeting as soon as we had a means of communicating our meetings (Meetup) and a place to meet (Etsy). 

10:
(problems and solutions: welcoming space, where to meet)

As I've said, we think it's important to make a space that people who don't normally feel welcomed in hackerspaces can go. We've debated how best to accomplish this - our current solution, of allowing only members of those groups by default, is a solution, but also a work in progress. We're experimenting to see how best to build a community that works for us.

The other problem's a little less interpersonal. Finding a venue to meet at in New York City that can handle a variable number of people and projects that might catch fire without costing a fortune is hard. Right now, we're meeting at Etsy Labs, because Katherine knows people who can book the space for us. Eventually, we might want a home where we can meet more than once a month, or store projects as they grow over time. We'll have to spend significant time and expense finding a venue when that time comes.

11:
(next steps: traction, membership, permanent home)

Right now, we meet once a month, and a few people come every time. That's success, as far as I'm concerned. But just because I have a space where I can go once a month to make things doesn't mean the general problem is solved. A lot of people who might be interested in us simply don't know we exist. I'm trying to solve that by doing things like tabling at Maker Faire, and giving this talk. 
Once more people know about us, we'll be able to determine if our community is large enough for us to be able to afford a permanent space through charging dues. Hackerspace dues typically are paid in exchange for member-only access to events, some tools, and a personal locker within the hackerspace, and are used to afford and improve the space. We don't have anything worth charging for right now, but if we had a permanent space, we would be able to store equipment and hold more events, and build a bigger community.

12:
(thanks)

There's a lot of people who helped me get to this stage that I want to thank.
    Katherine Daniels (@beerops), for cofounding MergeSort with me. 
    Meetup, my employer
    Etsy, for hosting MergeSort meetups
    Double Union, especially Valerie Aurora and Amelia Greenhall, for being transparent and willing to share throughout the process of starting their space. Val spent time talking to me about their steps to success, and Amelia wrote an incredibly thorough blog post, which I recommend you check out if you want to start a hackerspace.
    Squidwrench, especially Sean Swehla and Teresa Maranzano. Squidwrench is my home hackerspace, and Sean and Teresa have been role models and friends to me.
